    description: "Yes yes yes, today is the day. We have a great announcement for you peeps. A few people have been testing the feel and the overall idea of the Minecraft Server. But today I proudly announce that the 1st of April will be the start of Season 1 of the Geoluread Server.\n\n But for a new season we need planning, lot's of it. With this planning we can truly get everything out of the Minecraft Server. Here is a list of thing that we need to decide.\n **-** _A few rules, not too much,_\n **-** _A seed,_\n **-** _Decide what to do when the new nether is added,_\n **-** _And maybe some more..._\nIn <#689929818795409543> I will be posting a few ideas on which you can vote. If an idea gets a good amount of üëçüèø's and it's within the margin of Vanilla Minecraft (meaning no mods or plugins), I will try to implement it to Season 1. \n\nThe most important thing of this server is just to have fun really. Nothing more, nothing less. I hope that someday we don't need rules and just use our common sence.\n\n Yours faithfully,\n Geoluread. |",
