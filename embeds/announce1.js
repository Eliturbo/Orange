    description: "Dear Geos,\n\nThe server is **online**!!! From now on you can join the server using the information in <#684408609257422960>. In this channel you can also find what datapacks we make use of.\n\nA few people cannot join the server. This is because the server has a _whitelist_. If you want to join, just dm your Minecraft username to <@684752413294460971>. Then I will add you to the whitelist.\n_A list of the Geos who are whitelisted can also be found in <#684408609257422960> in the near future._\n\nIf there are any more questions regarding the Minecraft Server or why people are such a bitch sometimes: <#681103425165066301> is the place to be. \n\n Yours faithfully,\n Geoluread. |",
